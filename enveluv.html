        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

        <div class="para">
        <p>Enveluv was designed to provide women and girls with a controlled, protected social platform and the tools
           they need to safely find pen pals around the world. </p>

        <p>While technology has opened doors for international communication, new safety concerns have also developed.
           It‘s not unusual for women to feel targeted while searching online communities, regularly facing multiple threats to their
            comfort and safety including online bullying, catfishing, and sexual harassment. </p>

        <p>Many forfeit their ability to enjoy certain pleasures, like finding a pen pal, because it can be too risky.
           But why should we let idiots ruin our fun?</p>
         </div>

          <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
          <div class="para">
          <p>Women need the opportunity to use modern technology to safely connect with each other, especially when recieving letters to their home address. </p>

          <p>Several studies were conducted and it was determined that the target users came from a narrow demographic that had two primary motivations:</p>
          </div>

           <div id="box1"><p>To network in a safe environment</p></div>
           <h1 id="and">&</h1>
           <div id="box2"><p>To connect with a pen pal quickly to begin letter exchanges</p></div>

            <div class="para">
            <p>According to the survey results, over 80% of all women tested were between the ages of 18 and 35. 86% of the participants stated that they wouldn’t wait
               longer than two weeks to find a pen pal, so we know that this application needs to make the process as fast as possible for the audience.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="box4"><p>Over 80% between 18 - 35</p></div>
            <h1 id="and">&</h1>
            <div id="box5">86% wouldn't wait longer than 2 weeks</div>

            <div class="para">
            <p>To design an application for such a specific audience, it is vital to have a thorough understanding of their motivations and pain points. </p>

            <p>Girls from the previous survey were interviewed about their personalities, habits, and interests, uncovering why each of them were interested in sending
               handwritten letters to their friends and the problems they had encountered using other methods. </p>

            <p>This information lead to the creation of User Stories, which provided direction throughout the entire design process.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>PROCESS</h4>

            <div class="para">
            <p>Wireframes were created, prioritizing the features that best resolved the user’s frustrations. Wireframing is key to organizing features and information,
               reinforcing the hierarchy of the page and ensuring that nothing important gets left out.</p>

            <p>Multiple versions of each page were sketched out, and the best ones were tested for usability. Some pages went through a vigorous cycle of iterating and testing,
               like the “Letter History” page (shown under Revisions) and the “Contacts” display.</p>

            <p>The wireframes that passed user testing were turned into Hi-Fi Mockups.</p>

            <h4>BRANDING</h4>

            <div class="para">
            <p>The branding direction was integral to the function of this website as there was not only a narrow target audience, but perhaps the most critical audience of aesthetics.</p>

            <p>To bring to mind the image of written letters, it was obvious that a carefully chosen hand-written typeface would be the best choice for the logo. I selected “Breakfast and Chill”
               because it was a feminine hand-written cursive that was still readable and brought about a sense of realness.</p>

            <p>Vintage postal stripes inspired the color palette for this project. Some changes were made to keep the palette modern; For example, dark navy was traded for shades of turquoise.
               An off-white reminiscent of old school manilla paper was added into the palette, and dark brown was used in place of black to feel soft and warm. Pops of red are used conservatively
               but unconventionally throughout the site.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="para">
            <p>A prototype was created and tested, and upon reviewing the feedback, alterations were made to the final design.</p>

            <h4>SOLUTION</h4>

            <div class="para">
            <p>During the design process, it became clear that one of the most useful tools available to a designer is their audience.
               User testing provides guidance and direction when there is uncertainty, and User Personas and Stories keep the designer focused on the goal.</p>
