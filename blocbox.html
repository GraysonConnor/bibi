    <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

    <p>Anyone that uses the internet regularly knows that storing online information can be messy.
       Keeping track of bookmarked pages, saved photos, notes, and messages can waste time and cause
       the loss of important information. </p>

    <p>Blocbox is an SaaS application that provides a solution by offering users a simple way to
       store links, photos, and notes all in one place. Not only can users easily store online information,
       but they can also share and collaborate with others as needed. </p>

    <div class="view-prototype" id="view-prototype-top"><a href="#">VIEW PROTOTYPE</a></div>


    <div class="line-separator2"></div>

    <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>

    <p>User Surveys provide information about preferred devices, internet browsing patterns, and potential competitors.
       Drawing characteristics from survey participants contributed to the development of user personas for potential
       clients.</p>

    <p>This information helped me create features and wireframes that best served my target audience.</p>

    <p>Because Blocbox is an application intended to increase the efficiency of storing content electronically,
       the appearance of the website needed to be as clear and simple as possible. User flow charts illustrated
       the exact direction each page would move in, eliminating the clutter of any unnecessary features while ensuring that
        no vital functions went missing.</p>


        <div id="user-flows">
            <object data="images/userflows.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
        </div>



        <div class="line-separator3"></div>


        <h4>STYLE GUIDE</h4>

        <p>Storage websites can sometimes appear sterile and lack communication. I wanted Blocbox to be both visually stimulating
          and direct, so I made two style guide variations to test.</p>

          <div id="style-guid">
            <object data="images/styleguid.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
          </div>

          <div class="line-separator4"></div>

          <h4>REITERATIONS</h4>

          <p>Because Usability Testing is essential throughout the design process, I didn’t hesitate to send out multiple tests including
             the prototypes of my designs.</p>

          <p>Initially, the teal and orange color scheme were preferred, but user feedback stated that it was too cartoonish. I corrected this
             by changing the color scheme from teal and orange to green and orange, where green better reinforces a more organized, secure feeling.</p>

          <div id="reits">
             <object data="images/reits.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
          </div>

          <p>Results from user testing told me that my first home page design was confusing; the carousel reviews weren’t the most intuitive choice,
            and the color pattern in the pricing section was slightly too confusing for users. </p>

          <p>The revised version of the home page included a simplified reviews section and added a third color to the pricing section.</p>

          <div class="line-separator5"></div>

          <h4 id="summary">SUMMARY</h4>

          <p>The design process, especially implementing user research, showed me how less is more. Simplicity allows for the clearest communication,
             the most beautiful design, and the highest level of functionality.</p>
